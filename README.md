# Area_calculator

## Html, Css & Javascript School
This project is part of the practical javascript course taught at [platzi.com](platzi.com)

This code is part of a series of practical exercises for my learning Html, Css and Javascript.

## Area calculator
This exercise basically consists of practicing the interactivity of Html with Javascript. You can calculate the areas of the indicated figures just by inserting the dimensions.

Try the app on this [link](https://frankgranados.github.io/Area_calculator/)

## Mobile first

The css uses the Mobile first design strategy, where the process begins by first thinking about how it is going to apply to small screens (smartPhones or Mobile) and from there to grow the design to adapt to larger screens such as tablets. and computers.
